            <b>Def :</b> A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital
            asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual
            coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of
            computerized database using strong cryptography to secure
            transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins,
            and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not
            exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not
            issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use
            decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and
            central banking systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created
            prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally
            considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control,
            each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology,
            typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial
            transaction database.
